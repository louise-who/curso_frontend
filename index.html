    <h1>#1 On the beach at night alone</h1>
   <h2><a href="https://amenteemaravilhosa.com.br/biografia-de-walt-whitman/">- Walt Whitman</a> </h2>

<br>
<br>On the beach at night alone,
<br>As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,
<br>As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef of the universes and of the future.</br>
<br>A vast similitude interlocks all,
<br>All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
<br>All distances of place however wide,
<br>All distances of time, all inanimate forms,
<br>All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in different worlds,
<br>All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes,
<br>All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,
<br>All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe,
<br>All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,
<br>This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann’d,
<br>And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.
