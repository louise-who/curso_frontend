    <h2>#1 On the beach at night alone</h2>
   <h3><a href="https://amenteemaravilhosa.com.br/biografia-de-walt-whitman/">- Walt Whitman</a> </h3>

<p>
<br>On the beach at night alone,
<br>As the old mother sways her to and fro singing her husky song,
<br>As I watch the bright stars shining, I think a thought of the clef of the universes and of the future.</br>
<br>A vast similitude interlocks all,
<br>All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets,
<br>All distances of place however wide,
<br>All distances of time, all inanimate forms,
<br>All souls, all living bodies though they be ever so different, or in different worlds,
<br>All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes, the fishes, the brutes,
<br>All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages,
<br>All identities that have existed or may exist on this globe, or any globe,
<br>All lives and deaths, all of the past, present, future,
<br>This vast similitude spans them, and always has spann’d,
<br>And shall forever span them and compactly hold and enclose them.

<h2>#2 Lady Lazarus</h2>
<h3><a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plath">- Sylvia Plath</a> </h3>
<p>
<br>I have done it again.   
One year in every ten   
I manage it—— 
<br> sort of walking miracle, my skin   
Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   
My right foot
<br>A paperweight,
My face a featureless, fine   
Jew linen.
<br>Peel off the napkin   
O my enemy.   
Do I terrify?——
<br>The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   
The sour breath
Will vanish in a day.
<br>Soon, soon the flesh
The grave cave ate will be   
At home on me
<br>And I a smiling woman.   
I am only thirty.
And like the cat I have nine times to die.
<br>This is Number Three.   
What a trash
To annihilate each decade.
<br>What a million filaments.   
The peanut-crunching crowd   
Shoves in to see
<br>Them unwrap me hand and foot——
The big strip tease.   
Gentlemen, ladies
<br>These are my hands   
My knees.
I may be skin and bone,
<br>Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   
The first time it happened I was ten.   
It was an accident.
<br>The second time I meant
To last it out and not come back at all.   
I rocked shut
<br>As a seashell.
They had to call and call
And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.
<br>Dying
Is an art, like everything else.   
I do it exceptionally well.
<br>I do it so it feels like hell.   
I do it so it feels real.
I guess you could say I’ve a call.
<br>It’s easy enough to do it in a cell.
It’s easy enough to do it and stay put.   
It’s the theatrical
<br>Comeback in broad day
To the same place, the same face, the same brute   
Amused shout:
<br>‘A miracle!’
That knocks me out.   
There is a charge
<br>For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   
For the hearing of my heart——
It really goes.
<br>And there is a charge, a very large charge   
For a word or a touch   
Or a bit of blood
<br>Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   
So, so, Herr Doktor.   
So, Herr Enemy.
<br>I am your opus,
I am your valuable,   
The pure gold baby
<br>That melts to a shriek.   
I turn and burn.
Do not think I underestimate your great concern.
<br>Ash, ash—
You poke and stir.
Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——
<br>A cake of soap,   
A wedding ring,   
A gold filling.
<br>Herr God, Herr Lucifer   
Beware
Beware.
<br>Out of the ash
I rise with my red hair   
And I eat men like air.</br>

   <h2>#3 Life in the woods</h2> 
   <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden">- Henry David Thoreau</a></h3>

   <p>
    <br>I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. </br>
    <br>I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practice resignation, unless it was quite necessary. </br>
    <br>I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion.</br>
